# SCI Healthcare — Indexer &amp; API | [Documentation](https://otobongdev.github.io/sci-healthcare-contracts/)

> **Live:** [App](https://sci-healthcare.vercel.app) · [API](https://sci-healthcare-api.onrender.com/stats) · [Docs](https://otobongdev.github.io/sci-healthcare-contracts/) · [Contracts on testnet](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CBAOY2SQSMEIEQEITLZ3U3MER3K4ZBFQ5BTV5OCODAJINMXNOGLENC5I)

Indexes Soroban contract events from the [SCI Healthcare care-voucher protocol](https://github.com/otobongdev/sci-healthcare-contracts) into a queryable read model, and serves it over a read-only HTTP API.

The ledger is the source of truth. This service exists because a ledger cannot answer "show me every voucher this clinic is waiting on" without scanning it. Everything here is a projection: delete the database, replay from the deploy ledger, and you get the same rows back.

One click provisions the web service and its Postgres instance in the same
region, with every contract id already set. The only value you add by hand is
`CORS_ORIGIN`, once the frontend URL exists.

## Two properties worth stating up front

**It holds no keys and signs nothing.** Every state change in this protocol is a transaction signed in the user's wallet and submitted straight to Soroban RPC by the browser. This service is not in the write path. There is no custody here to steal.

**It stores no patient data.** The only patient-linked value is `beneficiaryRef`, an opaque 32-byte HMAC computed in the user's browser under a key that never leaves it. Nothing is written here that is not already public on chain, so a database breach is not a health-data breach.

## Architecture

```
  Soroban RPC ──getEvents──> Indexer ──> SQLite / Postgres ──> Fastify (read-only)
                             (cursor,                                   │
                              idempotent                                ▼
                              upserts)                              Frontend
```

The indexer polls on an interval, applies each event to the read model, and only then advances its cursor — so a crash mid-batch replays rather than skips. Handlers are idempotent upserts keyed by on-chain id, which makes replay safe.

## API

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | Liveness |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness, including how many ledgers the indexer trails the chain by |
| `GET /stats` | Protocol counters for the dashboard |
| `GET /providers` | Verified clinics, filterable by `status`, `country`, `q` |
| `GET /providers/:address` | One clinic and its service catalogue |
| `GET /vouchers` | Vouchers by `funder`, `provider`, `beneficiaryRef` or `status` |
| `GET /vouchers/:id` | One voucher, with its care receipt if settled |
| `GET /receipts?beneficiaryRef=` | A patient's settled care history |

`GET /vouchers` **requires at least one filter**. An unfiltered dump of every voucher is not a useful endpoint and invites scraping.

`/receipts` requires an exact `beneficiaryRef`. Because that value is an HMAC under a key held by the patient, the endpoint cannot be walked to enumerate people.

### Example

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/providers?status=Active" | jq
curl "http://localhost:8080/vouchers?provider=GDOOCNK2...ZKBK" | jq
```

```json
{
  "total": 1,
  "providers": [
    {
      "address": "GDOOCNK2HL6TB2Y7FDYNNMG4GTM2PNPY4XCTWG2INFPYYVA66FCPZKBK",
      "name": "Ikeja General Clinic",
      "country": "NG",
      "status": "Active",
      "services": [
        { "code": 101, "label": "Outpatient consult", "price": "30000000", "priceDisplay": "3.0000000" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Amounts are `i128` on chain and are returned as **decimal strings**. Parsing one into a JavaScript number loses precision above 2^53 — use `BigInt`.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/otobongdev/sci-healthcare-backend
cd sci-healthcare-backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # fill in the contract ids below
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

## Environment

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | HTTP port | `8080` |
| `HOST` | Bind address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | pino level | `info` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Comma-separated allowed origins | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Resolved **relative to `prisma/`** | `file:./dev.db` |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC endpoint | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` |
| `NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | Network passphrase | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` |
| `REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` | Registry contract | `CCY4K4FO3J4PHM7VQTTS4F5N5U3G7PJJQR5V7TGLYHGZQH2BQ2MQY77L` |
| `VOUCHER_CONTRACT_ID` | Voucher escrow | `CBAOY2SQSMEIEQEITLZ3U3MER3K4ZBFQ5BTV5OCODAJINMXNOGLENC5I` |
| `RECEIPT_CONTRACT_ID` | Care receipts | `CC25Q56WGEKNP4IDYOZK7BJJYD7JQ73JNCBAZIAEY4WCIVSUORQTS7PT` |
| `USDC_CONTRACT_ID` | Settlement token | `CCKJV474HALEXYJC6URWG2QMUDPH5LY2SKAYA2S4TFHJTXW7OU4OAERQ` |
| `INDEXER_START_LEDGER` | Ledger to index from; `0` means start at the tip | `4465529` |
| `INDEXER_POLL_MS` | Poll interval | `5000` |

Set `INDEXER_START_LEDGER` to the deployment ledger. Leaving it at `0` starts at the current tip and silently skips all prior history. Soroban RPC also only retains a rolling window of ledgers (about 7 days on testnet) — an indexer that falls further behind than the window cannot catch up, and `/ready` will say so rather than pretend otherwise.

## Deploying

Suited to a platform that runs long-lived processes with a database attached, such as Render.

- Runtime: Node 22
- Build: `npm ci && npx prisma generate && npm run build`
- Start: `npm run db:migrate && npm start`
- Switch `provider` in `prisma/schema.prisma` from `sqlite` to `postgresql`
- Provision the database in the **same region** and use its internal connection string

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). It documents the one trap this codebase has already hit: contract event fields marked `#[topic]` arrive in the topic list, not the data map, and reading them off the data map corrupts rows silently rather than crashing.

Security reports go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
