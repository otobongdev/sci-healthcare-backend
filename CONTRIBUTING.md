# Contributing to SCI Healthcare Backend

This service indexes Soroban contract events into a queryable read model and
serves them over a read-only HTTP API.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # fill in contract ids from the contracts repo
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

You need contract ids from a deployment. Either run `scripts/deploy.sh` in
`sci-healthcare-contracts`, or use the testnet addresses in that repo's README.

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Non-negotiables

- **The database is a projection, never a source of truth.** Deleting it and
  replaying from the deploy ledger must reproduce it exactly. Do not add a
  column that cannot be derived from on-chain events.
- **This service is read-only and holds no keys.** It never signs or submits a
  transaction. Every write is signed in the user's wallet. Any PR that adds a
  signing key to this service will be rejected.
- **Never store patient-identifying data.** Only the opaque `beneficiaryRef`.
  Nothing may be written here that is not already public on chain.
- **i128 amounts are strings, never numbers.** `Number` silently loses precision
  above 2^53. Use `BigInt` for arithmetic and store decimal strings.
- **Event handlers must be idempotent.** The indexer replays on crash, so use
  upserts keyed by on-chain id.

## Decoding events

The trap this codebase has already hit once: fields marked `#[topic]` in the
Rust event struct are published in the event's **topic list**, not in its data
map. Reading them off the data map yields `undefined`, which then stringifies
into the database as the literal text `"undefined"` — a silent corruption, not a
crash.

`TOPIC_FIELDS` in `src/stellar/events.ts` restores names onto positional topic
values and **must** be kept in step with the contracts. If you add an event or
move a field between topic and data, update that map in the same change and add
a case to `src/__tests__/events.test.ts`.

## Commits and PRs

Conventional commits, one logical change each:

```
feat(api): filter vouchers by expiry window
fix(indexer): advance the cursor only after a batch commits
test(events): cover an event with no data fields
```

- `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` must pass.
- New endpoints need a test and a README entry.
- Endpoints that return user data must require a specific filter. An unfiltered
  dump invites scraping and will not be merged.

## Wave program

Issues carry `trivial` (100), `medium` (150) or `high` (200) complexity labels.
